0.1.2 (2015-10-05)
==================
Implement the `affectsRegistration` option on `Cli`.

0.1.1 (2015-09-17)
==================
Added a HOW-TO.

Additions/improvements:
 - Added a utility method `Bridge.getIntentFromLocalpart`.
 - `Intent` instances will now ensure that the user is registered.
 - `AppServiceRegistration` from `matrix-appservice` is now exported on
   `matrix-appservice-bridge` so end-developers don't need to
   `npm install matrix-appservice`.

Breaking changes:
 - Changed the function signature of `Cli.generateRegistration` - the first
   arg is now an `AppServiceRegistration` and not a `String`.
