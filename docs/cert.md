 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.rethink3.orange-labs.fr/fullchain.pem.
   Your cert will expire on 2016-04-25. To obtain a new version of the
   certificate in the future, simply run Let's Encrypt again.
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Let's Encrypt
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Let's
   Encrypt so making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
